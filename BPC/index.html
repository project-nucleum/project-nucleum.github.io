Computing is a ubiquitous part of modern life. However, it is also clear that large groups of our population are not yet included in computing research, education, and jobs. As a part of <a href="https://project-nucleum.github.io">Project NUCLEUM</a>, this annual workshop series tries to address this problem by using the research project outcome to provide educational experiences and tools that span various levels of the future computer science workforce pipeline. We aim to accomplish the following list of goals: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="#ws-std">Student Workshop</a>: High school students will be exposed to machine learning through one-day workshops at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ)</li>
	<li><a href="#ws-pd">Teacher Workshop</a>: K-12 teachers will gain professional development opportunity to learn how they can incorporate AI concepts in their classrooms</li>

			<ul>
			<li>(15 min) Several examples of applications (e.g., evacuation from city in a wildfire)</li>
			<li>(60 min) Teachers will be introduced to software tools that are used in projects introduced in Session 2</li>
			<li>(90 min) A couple of demo lessons that teach teachers that illustrate what theyâ€™ve learned in Session 1 & 2 into a new or similar topic. This will support teachers' ability to envision implementation in their curriculum.</li>
			</ul>
			There will be a 15 min break between (b) and (c).
